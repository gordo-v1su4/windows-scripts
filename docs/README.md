## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

### The Hybrid Approach
- **Windows (Host):** PowerShell, VS Code, Windows-specific tools via Scoop
- **WSL2 (Ubuntu):** Primary dev environment, Bun, pnpm, Python, etc.

### Why Bun + pnpm?
- **Bun:** Blazing fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner
- **pnpm:** Saves gigabytes by storing packages once, hard-linking to projects
- **Result:** No more duplicate `node_modules` folders eating your disk!

### Clean Windows Philosophy
1. Minimal installations on Windows
2. Isolated package management (Scoop)
3. Dev work happens in WSL2
4. Regular automated cleanup
5. Version control everything
